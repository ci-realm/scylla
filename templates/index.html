<h1 id="nix-flavoured-continuous-integration">Nix Flavoured Continuous Integration</h1>
<p>Scylla is a simple CI server that solves one thing: Evaluate <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix</a> derivations and inform you and GitHub about the results.</p>
<p>Scylla is implemented in Go, and needs nothing but Nix for building, logging, and caching.</p>
<p>I try to keep the moving parts as reliable as possible, since at the end of the day, all we care about is that it works.</p>
<h2 id="what-scylla-can-do-for-you">What Scylla Can Do For You</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create binaries</li>
<li>Run tests</li>
<li>Populate your Nix cache</li>
<li>Update your GitHub PR status</li>
<li>Serve logs of your project builds</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Get an OAuth token</p>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens" class="uri">https://github.com/settings/tokens</a> and generate a new OAuth token. It only needs the <code>repo:status</code> permission.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the webhook</p>
<p>Go to <code>https://github.com/$owner/$repo/settings/hooks</code> (substitute your <code>owner</code>/<code>repo</code> in the URL).</p>
Add a webhook that points to your server, like <code>https://$host/hooks/github</code> (substitute <code>host</code> here to the location of your server, you can also use something like <a href="http://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> for trying it out).<br />
These settings are required:
<ul>
<li>Content type: <code>application/json</code></li>
<li>Secret: (anything you want)</li>
<li>Enable at least the <code>pull request</code> event. The rest will at the momemt be simply ignored.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Configure the server</p>
<p>Configuration is done via Environment variables (although flags also work). You need to set the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>: The token you created in the first step</li>
<li><code>GITHUB_USER</code>: The token you created in the first step</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Building the server</p>
<pre><code>nix build -f .</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Running the server</p>
<pre><code>./result/bin/scylla</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add a <code>ci.nix</code> file to the project you want to use it with.</p>
<p>The following is just an example of the structure. Itâ€™s strongly recommended that you use a pinned version of <code>nixpkgs</code> so both Scylla and you are actually building identical things.</p>
<pre><code class="nix">{ nixpkgs ? import (fetchGit {
  url = https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs;
  ref = &quot;24429d66a3fa40ca98b50cad0c9153e80f56c4a2&quot;;
}) {} }: {
  app-binary = callPackage ./. {};
  app-tests = recurseIntoAttrs {
    callPackage ./. { slowTests = true; };
    callPackage ./. { fastTests = true; };
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>All atributes in the returned attrset will be evaluated, in this case <code>app-binary</code> and <code>app-tests</code>. What Scylla actually does is to simply call <code>nix-build</code> on your <code>ci.nix</code> and store the results.</p>
<p>So you can make sure the <code>ci.nix</code> is working by doing that yourself first locally.</p>
<p>The <code>recurseIntoAttrs</code> function can be used to also build nested attrsets. Otherwise only functions in the top-level will be built.</p></li>
</ol>
